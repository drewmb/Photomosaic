Photomosaic
===========

Creates a photomosaic of a given picture.  Coded in Processing.

COUPLE NOTES:
-Program will require a database of pictures in order the Photomosaic to work. The default folder that was used can be found at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7iv70d36fs38c1r/cyTpbwAIrL

-Current version requires user to modify target picture to be taken into a Photomosaic.  That'll be changed later.
