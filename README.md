Photomosaic
===========

Creates a photomosaic of a given picture.  Coded in Processing. 

This program will require a database of pictures in order the Photomosaic to work. The default folder that was used can be found at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7iv70d36fs38c1r/cyTpbwAIrL

UPDATE 10-1-2013:
- Program now lets users select any image he wants without hardcoding it in
- put the size function at the beginning of the setup function to maintain consistancies of the Processing language
- separated certain drawing methods from the setup function into the draw function
